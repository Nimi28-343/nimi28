# classify images of cats 

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project leverages AI to "classify images of cats." Using machine learning techniques, it aims to provide accurate and efficient solutions to the problem of classifying various images of cats, enhancing automation and analysis in environments that require image recognition tasks.

## Background

Classifying images of cats is a common task in machine learning and computer vision. It can be challenging because of the vast variety in cat breeds, poses, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. While there has been significant progress in AI-driven image classification, this specific task could benefit from a targeted solution that uses deep learning to improve accuracy and speed in classifying cat images.
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Saving time – automating manual image classification tasks
* Providing insights – helping researchers, animal shelters, and online platforms improve the categorization process
* Improving accuracy – reducing human error and bias

## How is it used?

Animal Shelters & Pet Adoption Platforms: They can use this model to automatically tag and categorize images of cats to improve their online catalog of adoptable pets.
Research: It can assist in gathering data and insights about different cat breeds, their traits, and behaviors.
E-commerce: Platforms selling pet-related products can integrate the solution to automatically classify product images (like cat toys, food, and accessories).

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
    users = ['Researchers and scientists', 'E-commerce platforms', 'Cat lovers']

    for user in users:
        print(f"User: {user} can use the classification model for their specific needs.")

    from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
    model = load_model('cat_classifier_model.h5')
    print("Loaded pre-trained model.")

main()

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dataset     | Public dataset from Kaggle, "Dogs vs. Cats" |
| Model       | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) |
| Techniques  | Image Preprocessing, Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation |


## Challenges

Breed-specific categorization: The model does not identify specific cat breeds yet, only distinguishing whether an image contains a cat or not.
Low-quality images: Poor image quality, excessive noise, or images with obscure features might impact the model’s accuracy.
Non-cat images: The current solution does not address the classification of non-cat objects, limiting its application to specific datasets.ing a solution like this?

## What next?

Breed classification: Extend the model to categorize different cat breeds, making it more useful for breeders or researchers.
Improved accuracy: Further training with a larger, more diverse dataset could improve accuracy and performance across various scenarios.
Real-time classification: Implementing the model in a real-time environment, such as live video feeds from animal shelters or pet cameras.
